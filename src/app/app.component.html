        How can I get help if I'm stuck on a challenge?
      </summary>
      <p class="text">
        If you're stuck on a Frontend Mentor challenge, here are some ways to
        get help: Double-check the README, style guide, and design files for
        details. If you're on the Pro plan, use the Figma file for precise
        layouts. Break the challenge into smaller parts, and tackle one section
        at a time. Use browser DevTools to inspect elements and debug issues.
        Google your problem and check documentation on MDN, CSS-Tricks, and
        Stack Overflow. Join the Frontend Mentor Discord or post in the forum to
        ask for help. Share your code, issue, and what you've triedâ€”the
        community is there to help! You can also look at other developers'
        solutions for inspiration (but donâ€™t copy them). Finally, sometimes
        taking a break and coming back with fresh eyes can help you solve the
        problem. Let me know if you need help with a specific challenge! ðŸ˜Š
